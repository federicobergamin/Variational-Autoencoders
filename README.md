## Variational Autoencoders

Personal implementation of the paper *"AutoEncoding Variational Bayes" by Kingma, D. P., & Welling, M. (2013)*. 
The main purpose of this repository is to make the paper implementation accessible and clear to people
that just started getting into Variational Autoencoders without having to look into highly optimized libraries.

TODO make this into a proper repo
